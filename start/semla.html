		<p class="description">The semla consists of a cardamom-spiced wheat bun which has its top cut off and insides scooped out, and is then filled with a mix of the scooped-out bread crumbs and almond paste, topped with whipped cream. The cut-off top serves as a lid and is dusted with powdered sugar. Today it is often eaten on its own, with coffee or tea. But the old version is eaten in a bowl of hot milk, also called Hetvägg (hot wall).</p>

    <h2>About this site</h2>
    <p>This is a site for me to play around and explore code and at the same time give my co-workers at <a href="http://kyan.com">Kyan</a> some Swedish words to add to their vocabulary. This site is created just for fun by <a href="http://twitter.com/msgunnarsson">@MsGunnarsson</a>.</p>
