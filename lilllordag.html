		<p class="english">Little Saturday</p>
		<p class="description">Lillördag is a nickname for Wednesday and means Little Saturday. It's a day for party and drinking but in a lighter way than Saturday. The word stems from the fact that Wednesday was the day all maids used to have time off, since they had to work on Saturdays.</p>
