		<p class="description">As we all know a chicken is a bird; a young delicious one made for eating. Swedes love their chicken, just as any other people. But what they don’t care about is being called one. Swedes are patient and would only start a fight if their life depended on it. Long gone are the days when calling a Swede a chicken would mean a torching of your village, roasting of your children (like a chicken) and one way trip to Sweden for your wife.</p>
		<h2>Use this word in a sentence</h2>
		<p lang="sv" class="sentence">Den här kycklingen är så rå att en skicklig veterinär kan återuppliva den.</p>
		<p class="sentence">This chicken is so raw a skilled vet could bring it back to life.</p>

		<h2>Pronunciation guide</h2>
		<h3>For the weird Swedish letters.</h3>
	</hgroup>
	<div>
		<h3 lang="sv" class="letter">Å</h3>
		<p class="description">The first of the three Swedish characters. You’ll find the sound just before the L in words that contain AL, like: all, alter and Aldershot. Try saying ALL, but skip out the L’s. It should sound something like a mix of A and O, and it should come from the back of your mouth.</p>
		<h3 lang="sv" class="letter">Ä</h3>
		<p class="description"><span lang="sv">Ä</span> is a rare sound in the British language. But if you try on an American accent and let out a fully fledge ass (or asshole), Cut away everything after the A you’ll have the hang of it. It should sound something like a mix of A and E. Just as <span lang="sv">Å</span> you’ll find the sound near your throat rather than the tip of your tongue.</p>
		<h3 lang="sv" class="letter">Ö</h3>
		<p class="description"><span lang="sv">Ö</span> is the same letter as the Norwegian and Danish <span lang="da">Ø</span>. If you, once again, try that American accent you can hear the sound in words like: skirt, flirt, nerd, turd and bird. It’s the sound just between the U/I and the R.</p>
