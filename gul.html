		<p class="description">Gul is the colour of Easter. Probably to set a strong reminder of all the yolk we’re about to fill ourselves with. Although eggs are far from the only thing Swedes eat during Easter, it is the most common one. And as in most parts of the world, everything that isn’t made of egg is egg-shaped during Easter.</p>
